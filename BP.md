# Web3NFT.Social(English)

## Project Info

* Project Name: Web3NFT.Social
* Project Start Time: 2022-05-20
* Online Demo: [Online Link](https://alfajores.web3nft.social/0xC6E58fb4aFFB6aB8A392b7CC23CD3feF74517F6C)

Web3NFT.Social arm to make every web2 creator easily create products and earn on web3.
AKA: Web3 NFT Creator Economic.

I've been studying social platforms, social engineering, and the dynamics between those 2 for 10 years. As every year will pop up some new social apps that I always install (over 200+ social apps on my phone some days) and try to find out the logic of why they built this and how can they succeed or beat old social applications. Make hundreds of notes about them too on my apple notes ;)

Now, Web3 doesn't have any Top 1 social app yet! And the Web3 NFT makes the assets fully owner I believe that will be a new Social company && product to support this.
I don't think a web2 company can do this well. As they already have a lot of users and they don't feel the big impact yet.
Even Facebook changes its name to Meta, currently as they have so many great developers but many months went we don't see they work as a web3 company yet. That's why they only buy Instagram and WhatsApp to keep their top 1 social company rank for the past 10 years. But now they cannot buy TikTok and lost the users then.

That's why I believe in the Web3 Social track, which makes everyone own their assets and data. As web2 social company can't lose these till some new web3 company kills them.

### Expand what we are building

1. Every product needs a start and focus point I would like to attract KOL of NFT project creator to use our product first.
2. Our product must help creators to publish creations back by web3 easily and help them make a profit.
3. A web3 LinkTree would be a start point and KOL would help to copy the link to their web2 social platform to share them.
4. Our system also supports content which publishes on IPFS but has NFT gating encrypt that only a special NFT holder can decrypt.
5. Also, we develop web3 social features such as follow/unfollow, and web3 chat(based on XMTP open-source code, but add the CyberConnect and NFT gating filters) with NFT gating that help users to go back to our platform.
6. We also plan to develop a web3 version of Twitter in our platform that require the user to spend platform credit to like/unlike, which make our platform have more valuable content and clears the trash flood messages.

## Marketing Highlights

### Connect with web2 by Chrome extension

We are building a Chrome extension(not ready yet) that will inject on every web page that provides features that help us connect to more users.

1. Give every URL a "rank", the rank at the beginning will only simply visited count but later they will have more complicated logic, at the end will make this rank usefully for every user that believes on the "rank" value, for example as a Twitter user profile page, if the user is an NFT project creator the higher value will make another user more trust for this project.
2. We provide NFT small "albums" for a special page such as on every Twitter profile page, the owner of the Twitter profile page can setup what kinds of NFT image shop on the top right corner, it's more like a web3 ads plugin for every web3 creator/user that injects into every page.
3. The plugin of course will give back more traffic to our system as our user/KOL growth

### Corotate with industry company

1. We have a connection with a local music recorder company that they have a bunch of singers that we will build a music module on our system to support them to publish song NFT/concert tickets and all of these will bring us more traffic, we will do this on more industry after we shipping GTM MVP.
2. We will make a lot of connections with NFT community KOL, he will give our team a lot of support later then. As his CTC NFT contract and the mint system were written by our team.
3. We will also contact more KOL of NFT projects to join us to use our products, and give away our platform's NFTs to attract them to brand us.

### More hacker growth strategies will be used after our GTM MVP is launched
